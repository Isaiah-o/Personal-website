            this is where i write an 'about me' but i don't 
            have anything to write yet, so i'm just going to add 
            filler words and sentences. fungus hopefully this looks pretty
            beliveable and not like the ramblings of a mad man.

          <p>
            when i have free time i like to spend it making music.
            i'm heavily influenced by the underground sound 
            and the many variations of  the <u>"plugg"</u> sub-genre.
              
          </p>
          <p>
            music was one of the things that peaked my intererst from 
            a really young age, i grew up in the south which heavily
            infuluenced the type of music i was introduced to
            as well as the different sub-cultures my parents were
            apart of; being practically kids in their early 20's and
            late teens
         </p>
            

          <p>
            as a kid i would take mp3's of my favorite songs and make 
            "mixtapes" from them. these mixtapes consisted of songs 
            i would slow down and add effects to, honestly nothing 
            stand-out or show worthy considering i was like 8 lol.
            however this eventually lead to me wanting to make
            my own songs and beats.

            dinner times for me growing up consisted of something super
            cheap and could made in abundance so taking the time to plan-
            out a fully well-rounded meal was never a thing i was used to. 
          </p>
          <p>
            cooking at home allows me to be fully in control of what i
            consume and helps regulate what i put in my body. by giving
            myself this freedom i'm fully responsible for how i feel, sleep,
            and function overall on a day-to-day basis.
         </p>
           ALSO! with the prices of everything incresing and portions remainng
            the same you can end up spending just as much if not more at
            a chipotle or chik fil than an actual sit-down restaurant.

            i once took a nap after school so deep it led to me sleeping
            in and through an entire hurricane that passed by the town
            i'm from.
          </p>
          <p>
            biggest sleeper over here honestly. there's nothhing i love and
            appreciate more than to lie down and turn the lights off and get 
            some rest.
            napping to me is like second nature! in under 10-mins i can be 
            asleep and on my way to REM. i've taught myself how to fall asleep
            quickly to maximize my total hours slept.   
         </p>

          <p>
            my favorite is sleeping outside and being able to listen to
            all the birds and wild animals in the forest around where i live.
            the temperature has been a little too cold for camping right now but
            as summer slowly approahces hopefully i'll be able to take a trip
            out to the wilderness to camp and sleep in the trees
